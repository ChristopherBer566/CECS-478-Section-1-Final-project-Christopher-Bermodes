1.	Data integrity
  a.	Maintained by:
    i.	SHA-256 hash chaining
    ii.	Perv_hash.bin: storing last chain head
    iii.	Verify_logs recomputing full chain of event logs
  b.	Integrity is maintained if:
    i.	Hashes are correct
    ii.	Every entry matches expected hash
    iii.	If any byte is changed verification fails
2.	Confidentiality
  a.	Use of TLS handshake with the use of OpenSSL
  b.	Encrypted communication between server and client
  c.	Threats mitigated:
    i.	MITM attacks
    ii.	Passive sniffing
    iii. Replay messages
3.	Log ordering
  a.	Hash chaining creating forward only chain
  b.	Verifier requires exact sequence match
    i.	If attacker modifies entry N -> Entry N + 1 fails verification 
4.	Data handling protocols
  a.	All logs stored in binary format to avoid accidental tampering
  b.	No logs transmitted over the network
  c.	Hash chain ensures integrity 
  d.	Insider tool simulates unauthorized modification
5.	Security validation strategy
  a.	Verify_log – detects any log modifications
  b.	Read_logs – confirms tamper detection
