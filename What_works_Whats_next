What works in current build:

1.	Functional TLS and TCP communication with client and server
  a.	Encrypted communication between client and server
  b.	Server receives and acknowledges client sent messages

2.	Tamper-Evident Hash-Chained Logging
  a.	Uses SHA-256 hash chaining
  b.	prev_hash.bin for secure chain continuation

3.	Modify attack simulation
  a.	insider.c modifies logs in tamperlog.bin
  b.	Attack breaks hash-chain integrity
  c.	verify_log.c detects modification of logs

4.	Human-readable log viewer
  a.	Shows message, timestamp, message, IP address, hash and sequence number


What’s next in current build:
1.	CI pipeline is generated by ChatGpt and is untested
  a.	Do tests with CI pipeline

2.	Multi-client support

3.	Stronger insider attack models
  a.	Timestamp manipulation
  b.	Header tampering

4. Signed Chained heads of hash chains
